A twitch chatbot for extra command functionality
Still a work in progress but already includes some helpful and fun functions.

Currently requires `esm` and `tmi.js` libraries. Provided one has npm:
```
npm init esm
npm i tmi.js
```

`constants.sample.js` in `src` should be changed `constants.js` and the data inside should be filled in correctly.
other files in `data` should be generated automatically
